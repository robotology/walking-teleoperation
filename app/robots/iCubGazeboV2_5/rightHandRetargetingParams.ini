# the following rotation map the teleoperation frame and the teleoperation robot
# frame the Teleoperation robot frame chosen is "imu_frame" and according to iCub
# CAD has:
# The z-axis is parallel to gravity but pointing upwards.
# The x-axis points behind the robot.
# The y-axis points laterally and is chosen according to the right-hand rule.
# the Teleoperation frame is attached to the virtualizer and the  origin is the
# same oculus inertial frame. In other words:
# The z-axis is parallel to gravity but pointing upwards
# The x-axis points forward
# The y-axis points laterally and is chosen according to the right-hand rule.
# So the rotation matrix is simply given by Rotz(pi)
